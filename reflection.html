          A developer should employ the responsive design strategy while
          designing a website. The goal of this method is to ensure that every
          web page is shown appropriately regardless of viewport size. To put it
          another way, the web page should be clean and legible not only on a
          computer, but also on phones and tablets. This includes readability
          when the browser window is enlarged or the screen resolution changes,
          such as from 640x480 to 4k. A developer should test the website with
          various screen resolutions and browser window sizes to ensure that the
          method is followed. It also necessitates the use of relevant CSS
          attributes for numerous HTML components in order for them to resize
          correctly.The technique also enables for alternative styles to be
          defined for different devices, such as a smartphone with a small
          screen and a touch control vs a PC with a large screen and a mouse
          control.

          Because a website may be seen on a variety of devices with varying
          screen resolutions, responsive design is critical for web technology.
          Furthermore, the web browser may be scaled on a single device,
          increasing the number of potential resolutions where the web page's
          look must be preserved. The option to specify distinct layouts for
          different devices is critical for touch screen devices, where it might
          be difficult to click on small elements or read small fonts. On a
          smartphone with touch control, some JavaScript events, such as
          mouseover, may be useless. As a result, a custom style based on
          additional JavaScript events may be required.
        </p>

          To follow the responsive design strategy, I discovered that HTML
          components require unique CSS attributes to determine their width,
          height, and other features. Using attributes like min-width/max-width
          and min-height/max-height, one may have HTML components resize
          automatically dependent on the viewport resolution. Additionally,
          rather than using pixel-related px, we may use viewport-related
          measures vw/vh to link measurements to viewport width and height. We
          may also use a percentage measure that is proportional to the size of
          the parent container. We can also use the grid-related CSS property
          grid-template-columns to have items take up the same amount of page
          space. Finally, we can use the @media query in CSS to give a unique
          look for a variety of resolutions. In any event, it's critical to
          evaluate the web page's look on a variety of suitable viewport
          resolutions during the development process.

          This course taught me the fundamentals of web design and development
          using technologies such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as best
          practises such as the responsive design approach. We received a lot of
          experience with projects and assessments that required us to construct
          web sites partially or completely from scratch. I am really happy with
          the course content since I am now able to design a simple web page,
          which allows me to progress to studying a more advanced web
          development framework, such as React, Angular, Django, or Laravel. I
          believe this course has adequately prepared me for WEB 322 next
          semester.
